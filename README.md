# Gel-Imager
Open source gel electrophoresis imaging system

##Problem

It is always a good idea to document the results of a gel run, but for a small lab like ours this means snapping a picture with our cell phone camera and email/texting it to ourselves so we can upload it into Benchling (our cloud lab notebook). This means the image quality is low (background light) and each image is different (depending who took the picture). Furthermore, if we want to do any post processing or make notes on the image we have to run it through separate software.

##Solution

We are building a low cost, easy to build, open source gel imager.
